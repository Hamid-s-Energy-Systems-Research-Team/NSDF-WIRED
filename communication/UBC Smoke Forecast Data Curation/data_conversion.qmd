# Data Conversion {#sec-data-conversion}

So far, we have established how to access the data from UBC and have it available on our local machine.

Here we describe the steps for compiling the data now on our machine into an IDX file using the [OpenViSUS libary](https://github.com/sci-visus/OpenVisus/tree/master) and its access to the [PIDX library](https://github.com/sci-visus/PIDX?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Overview

For all our conversion attempts, the same general process is followed:

1. Check which NetCDF files were successfully downloaded from the data source by attempting to open each downloaded file with `xarray`.
2. Step though all files in a chronological sequence, hour by hour, and save data at each hour to an `IDX` file using the [OpenVisus](https://github.com/sci-visus/OpenVisus/tree/master) framework.

In the next sections we will delineate the exact approaches taken, obstacles encountered, and modifications made.

### First Approach
The full script for our first approach is available in the side bar as v1.

Initially, we used just the BSC00CA12-01 forecast ID dataset as this ran to the latest available date.

### Second Approach


### Third Approach


### Fourth Approach
