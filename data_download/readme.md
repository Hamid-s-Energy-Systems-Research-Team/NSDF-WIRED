`get_data.py` downloads all netCDF files from the firesmoke.ca website.

We manually determined the earliest available files' dates to be March 4, 2021 for the BSC18CA12-01, BSC00CA12-01, BSC06CA12-01 datasets and March 3, 2021 for the BSC12CA12-01 dataset.

We also manually determined the latest available files' dates to be October 16, 2023 for BSC18CA12-01 and BSC06CA12-01, October 15, 2023 for BSC12CA12-01, and February 10, 2024 for BSC00CA12-01.

We did this by simply checking the firesmoke.ca website and downloading the earliest and latest dates available. It would be good to later confirm if there are earlier/later dates and redownloading and convert accordingly.
